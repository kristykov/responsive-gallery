# Gallery Content Component

## Project Description

This project features a responsive gallery grid displaying five images arranged in a precise, fixed order.
Each image serves as a link, with one image featuring a play button overlay.

The component is reusable â€” both the set of images and their corresponding descriptions (for the main view and modal window) can be easily replaced.

Keyboard navigation is fully supported: users can navigate across the grid using the Tab key.
When a user clicks the play button, an accessible modal window opens, embedding a YouTube video that starts playing automatically.
The modal traps focus while open and can be closed via a close button or by pressing the Escape key, which also stops the video playback to ensure a clean user experience.

The gallery is optimized for modern browsers and devices, ensuring responsiveness, performance, and accessibility in line with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
